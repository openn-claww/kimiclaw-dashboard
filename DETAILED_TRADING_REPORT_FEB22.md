## DECISION: STOP TRADING

- All money tied in positions
- Better to wait for resolutions

**PLAN:**
1. Wait for tonight's sports bets to resolve
2. Wait for tomorrow's BTC bets to resolve
3. Redeem all winnings automatically
4. Reassess wallet balance
5. Resume trading when $20+ available

---

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What I Did Right:
- Found 2 high-confidence BTC trades
- Proper analysis on most trades
- Kept some bets at $5 (correct sizing)

### What I Did Wrong:
- Nuggets bet was $8 (should be $5 max)
- Should have stopped at 3 trades
- Risked too much of bankroll in one day

### Improvements:
- Strict $5 max unless 90%+ confident
- Max 3 trades per day
- Keep 30% of bankroll free
- Wait for better setups

## NEXT STEPS

1. **WAIT** for positions to resolve
2. **MONITOR** auto-redeem notifications
3. **CHECK** wallet tomorrow morning
4. **RESUME** trading when balance $20+
5. **FOLLOW** new rules strictly

**Expected first redemption:** Tonight 8:30 PM GMT
