# DISCORD MONITORING WITHOUT WEBHOOKS

## OPTION 1: RSS FEEDS (Easiest)

Discord channels can have RSS feeds:
1. Go to: https://discordrss.xyz/
2. Enter Discord channel URL
3. Get RSS feed
4. I monitor the RSS feed

**Pros:** Free, no permissions needed
**Cons:** Only works for public channels

---

## OPTION 2: DISCORD BOT (Medium)

Create a bot that joins servers:
1. Go to: https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create New Application → Bot
3. Get bot token
4. I use bot to read messages

**Pros:** Can read any channel bot has access to
**Cons:** Needs "Read Messages" permission in each server

---

## OPTION 3: SCREENSHOT MONITORING (Jugaad)

If you have Discord open:
1. I take screenshots of channels
2. Use OCR to read text
3. Detect keywords

**Pros:** No API needed
**Cons:** Manual, not real-time

---

## OPTION 4: TELEGRAM BRIDGE (Best)

Many Discord servers have Telegram bridges:
1. Find Telegram version of Discord server
2. Join Telegram channel
3. I monitor Telegram (easier API)

**Popular Telegram channels:**
- @PolymarketNews
- @CryptoSignals
- @WhaleAlert

---

## OPTION 5: MANUAL CHECKING (Simplest)

You check Discord 2-3x per day:
1. Join servers
2. Pin important channels
3. When you see good alpha, forward to me
4. I analyze and trade

**Pros:** Zero setup
**Cons:** Not automated

---

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:

**Start with:**
1. **Telegram channels** (free, easy)
2. **Manual checking** (you forward good stuff)

**Later:**
3. **Discord bot** (if you want automation)

| Channel | Link | What They Post |
|---------|------|----------------|
