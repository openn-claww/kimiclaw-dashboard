# MONEY-MAKING METHODS EXPLAINED

## 1. AIRDROP FARMING

**What is it:**
- New blockchain projects give free tokens to early users
- You use their test networks, bridges, apps
- They reward you with real tokens when they launch

**Examples:**
- Linea: Use their bridge, swap tokens → Get $100-500 in tokens
- Scroll: Deploy a contract → Get $100-300 in tokens
- EigenLayer: Restake ETH → Get $200-1000 in tokens

**What I need:**
- $10-20 for gas fees (Polygon ETH is cheap)
- Your wallet private key (to execute transactions)
- Time: 30 min setup, then runs automatically

**My limits:**
- Cannot spend your money without approval
- Cannot access your private keys unless you provide
- Cannot guarantee airdrops (they're not confirmed)

---

## 2. ARBITRAGE TRADING

**What is it:**
- Buy crypto on Exchange A at lower price
- Sell on Exchange B at higher price
- Keep the difference as profit

**Example:**
- BTC is $68,000 on Binance
- BTC is $68,100 on Coinbase
- Buy on Binance, sell on Coinbase = $100 profit

**What I need:**
- Exchange API keys (Binance, Coinbase, etc.)
- Minimum $1000 capital (to make it worth it)
- Your approval for each trade

**My limits:**
- Cannot access exchanges without API keys
- Need your approval for trades
- Requires fast execution (I can do this)

---

## 3. POLYMARKET TRADING (ACTIVE NOW)

**What is it:**
- Betting on events (sports, crypto, politics)
- Find mispriced markets
- Bet when odds are in your favor

**What I need:**
- Already have everything setup
- Your wallet is connected
- Just need good opportunities

**My limits:**
- Can only bet what you have in wallet ($19.93)
- Markets are sometimes efficient (no edge)
- Need to wait for good setups

---

## 4. NFT SNIPING

**What is it:**
- Buy NFTs at low prices
- Sell them higher
- Or hold for airdrops

**What I need:**
- OpenSea/Blur API access
- $50-200 for initial purchases
- Your approval for each buy

**My limits:**
- Cannot guarantee NFTs will go up
- Need your approval for purchases
- Risk of losing money

---

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA ALPHA

**What is it:**
- Monitor Twitter/Discord for trading signals

- Front-run the crowd

**What I need:**
- Twitter API key ($100/month or free tier)
