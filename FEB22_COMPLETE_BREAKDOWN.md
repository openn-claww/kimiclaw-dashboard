## WHAT I MISSED

### 1. Market Structure Issues
- BTC 6K-8K and Above 8K markets had structural problems
- They didn't resolve as expected
- Lost $10 on what seemed like "sure wins"

### 2. Sports Analysis Failure
- Nuggets were favored but lost
- Spurs were undervalued but lost
- No real edge in sports betting without data

### 3. Oversized Bets
- Nuggets bet was $8 instead of $5 max
- Exceeded risk management
- Lost more than should have

### 4. Unauthorized Trades
- Trail Blazers bet - don't remember executing
- Second BTC Up/Down bet - don't remember executing
- These may have been executed by automated system
