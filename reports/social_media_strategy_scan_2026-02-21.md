**Evidence:**
- Multiple sources confirm this is the "easiest" edge for beginners
- Example: Trump 2028 nomination - Polymarket 62% vs Kalshi 68% = 9.7% guaranteed return
- Bots dominate this space but human traders can still compete on cross-market opportunities

**Risk Level:** Low (near-guaranteed profit if executed correctly)
**Capital Required:** $100-$5,000
**Time Commitment:** Low

**Source Citations:**
- Medium "Complete Polymarket Playbook" (highly cited)

- Most scalable and repeatable income stream
- Requires $10,000+ capital for meaningful returns

**Execution:**
- Place simultaneous orders: Buy YES at $0.46, Sell YES at $0.50
- Spread capture: $0.04 per share when both fill
- Target 1-2% profit per completed round trip

**Risk Level:** Low-Medium

### 3. INFORMATION ASYMMETRY / NEWS SCALPING ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (85% Confidence)

### 4. CONTRARIAN FADING OF EMOTIONAL MARKETS ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (82% Confidence)
**Description:** Bet against emotionally-charged markets where bias overwhelms rational probability.

**Best Applications:**
- Fan-favorite sports teams (Lakers, Yankees, Cowboys)
- Beloved political figures
- Viral meme stocks and coins
- Hyped entertainment events

**Example:**
- Lakers make NBA Finals: Objective 18% vs Market 32%
- Sell "Yes" at $0.32 for $0.32 profit per share if correct

**Psychological Basis:** Retail traders overpay for "hope" and underprice "boring" outcomes

**Risk Level:** Medium

**Source:** Reddit r/CryptoCurrency, Dropstab, various tracking dashboards

---

### 6. CORRELATION TRADING ⭐⭐⭐ (72% Confidence)
**Description:** Identify markets that should move together but are temporarily mispriced.

**Examples:**
- Trump wins presidency (45%) vs Republicans control Senate (35%)
- Historical correlation: 85% when Trump wins
- Expected Senate odds: 45% × 85% = 38%
- Trade: Buy Senate at 35% (underpriced)

**Categories:**
- Presidential winner + Senate control
- GDP + unemployment
- Inflation + Fed rate decisions
- Conference winners + championship odds

**Risk Level:** Medium (correlations can break)
**Source:** Medium Playbook, quantitative trading blogs

---

### 7. TIME DECAY / LONG-DATED POSITIONING ⭐⭐⭐ (70% Confidence)
**Description:** Exploit uncertainty premium in markets far from resolution.

**Mechanism:**
- Long-dated markets (6-12 months) often misprice rare outcomes
- Traders over-discount uncertainty
- Early positioning creates huge upside if thesis is correct

**Example:**
- "Bitcoin reaches $200K by December 2026" trading at $0.15 (15%)
- If your analysis shows 35% probability, buy at $0.15
- Expect price to rise to $0.30-$0.40 as December approaches

**Risk Level:** Medium
**Source:** Laika Labs, Medium Playbook

---

### 8. "NOTHING EVER HAPPENS" / FADE THE CHAOS ⭐⭐⭐ (68% Confidence)
**Description:** Bet that most geopolitical headlines resolve into nothing.

**Thesis:**
- 90% of geopolitical headlines create emotional spikes but resolve to nothing
- When YES jumps 10-20% on hype, buy NO
- Fundamentals rarely change as fast as headlines

**Best Markets:**
- War predictions
- Government shutdowns
- Extreme political events

**Risk Level:** Medium (tail events DO happen occasionally)
**Source:** Reddit r/CryptoCurrency (highly upvoted strategy)

---

### 9. MENTION MARKETS / PERSONALITY-DRIVEN TRADING ⭐⭐ (55% Confidence)
**Description:** Bet on whether specific words will be mentioned in speeches/earnings calls.

**Characteristics:**
- YES is structurally overpriced in short-duration mention markets
- Trump markets are popular ("rigged elections," "worst president," "tremendous")
- Default to NO unless speaker is historically chatty

**Example:**
- Buy at $0.80 when market opens
- Sell at $0.90 when cameras start rolling

**⚠️ Warning:** This is essentially gambling with no fundamental edge

**Risk Level:** High
**Source:** Reddit, Twitter/X threads

---

### 10. BOT AUTOMATION / ALGORITHMIC TRADING ⭐⭐ (50% Confidence)
**Description:** Deploy automated trading bots for speed advantages.

**Bot Types:**

- Whale-following bots

**Requirements:**
- Programming skills (Python/JavaScript)
- VPS with low latency to London (Polymarket servers)
- $50,000+ capital recommended

**⚠️ Reality Check:** Most retail bot traders lose money. Bots amplify both wins AND losses.

## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### Position Sizing Rules (High Confidence ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- Risk no more than **2-5% of bankroll per trade**
- Stop-loss at **25-30% drawdown**
- Take partial profits at **30-50% gains**
- Maintain **20% cash reserve minimum**

### Kelly Criterion Application
```
Optimal bet size = (Edge × Odds) / (Odds - 1)

Example:
- You estimate 60% probability
- Market price: $0.45
- Edge = 0.60 - 0.45 = 0.15
- Full Kelly = 27% (too aggressive)
- Pro approach: Half-Kelly = 13.5% max per trade
```

### Portfolio Construction ($10,000 Example)
- 50% core positions (5-7 high-conviction trades)
- 30% tactical trades (10-15 medium conviction)
- 20% cash reserve
